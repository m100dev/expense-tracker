# Light-weight expense tracking app built with React
## Overview
I created the project in tandem with a tutorial I followed. This project helped me to better understand some important React Concepts. These include state management with React's useState Hook, Lifting up state from a child component to a parent component. I learned how to separate and split code into individual components based on their function, and create reusable components.

# How to run the project locally
1. First clone the repo to a local directory using the `git clone` command in your terminal. If you don't have git installed, visit the [Git Website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the documentation to "git" it.
2. Open git BASH and navigate to the folder of the project. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. To start the project, run `npm run start`. This will run the script which will start the server on your local machine. You'll then be able to interact with the application.
